# ESE 2020
This repository contains important material (presentations, project description, schedule) to get started with the project.

## General information

* [ESE course page](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese)
* Use <a href="https://piazza.com/unibe.ch/fall2019/ese2020/home">Piazza</a> to ask questions and get answers.

The goal of project in the course "Introduction to Software Engineering (ESE)" is to offer a concrete and practical contact with the phases, techniques, and artefacts of an iterative and incremental software development process.

The lecture builds upon knowledge acquired in P1 and P2:

* P1 was about programming: what is a programming language and what is a program
* [P2](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/p2) was about development: how can we design a solution which follows the state of the art and what are the best programming practices?
* [ESE](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese) is about software engineering: how can we work in a team to deliver products which meet customer’s expectations

During the project, a concrete software is created through teamwork and it needs to be delivered as a product at the end of the semester — and this is really fun and cool :)

The final grade will be composed from 60% exam + 40% project.

# Project 

This year we will build a platform to sell/buy goods and services online. 
It is going to be a web application where registered users can post advertisements to sell or lend their goods and services. 
Similarly, other users can browse through the catalog of goods/services and consequently buy or rent the desired ones. 
For simplicity, actual payments will not be handled. 
Instead, we will have a toy implementation of the concept of money. 

# Project organization

Students/participants will be divided into small groups (each group will have roughly 4-5 students). Each group will build the software independently. One student from each group will act as a Product Owner (PO), who will co-ordinate the communication with assitant. PO will then proactively discuss the reqirements with his/her fellow team members.

The total duration for the project is 12 weeks. First 4 weeks will be given to learn technologies and clear the underlying concepts, also to start developing. The project will be developed as a series of **features**. Project will have three milestones (see [wiki](https://github.com/scg-unibe-ch/ese2020/wiki)), at each milestone we will evaluate and retrospect the progress made. Total 4 features will be built by students, out of which one will be a surprise feature by students.
Exercise hours mostly consist of meetings of assistants with their corresponding teams. However, there will be few weeks, where we will present few important topics.
